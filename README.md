# EmberCAD - Alpha Version

EmberCAD is a functional Alpha software designed to bridge the gap between design and laser execution.

## Project Status and Alpha Phase

The program is fully operational but is currently in its Alpha stage.

* Codebase: The project has developed organically. Priority was given to functionality and laser control precision, which resulted in technical debt. The code does not yet follow Clean Code principles.
* Source Available Model: I am sharing the source code to build a community and improve the tool. If you are a developer and see areas for refactoring or optimization, your Pull Requests are welcome.

## Important: Intellectual Property and Licensing

Please note that while the source code is public, the licensing is restrictive regarding commercial use:

* End User License: This software is provided for personal and professional use by end users.
* No Commercial Redistribution: You are not allowed to create derivative versions, rebrand the software, or bundle it with hardware (OEM) for sale without a specific commercial agreement.
* Copyright: All rights to the EmberCAD brand and its original architecture remain with the author. 

For commercial inquiries or licensing for laser manufacturers, please contact the author directly.

## About

## Collaboration
